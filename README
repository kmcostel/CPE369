Assignment: Lab 3
Date: 1/25/17

To execute:
1. run 'python createJs.py <inputjsonfile> > <outputJavaScriptFile>
2. run 'mongo <outputJavaScriptFile>' to insert data from <inputjsonfile> in previous step into mongo.
3. run 'mongo movieSurvey.js' to run queries on the data set and see the results of each query. 

Files:
1. 'createJS.py' is used for creating javascript files that insert data into mongo
2. 'insert.js' is an example file created from 'createJS.py'. 'insert.js' can be run with mongo to insert data into mongo
3. 'movieSurvey.mongo' is a text file containing all the queries for the assignment
4. 'movieSurvey.js' is a javascript file using mongo's API that runs queries and prints out their results.

Notes:
1. For query #4 I am excluding those who gave ratings of 0 for any of the movies (Rocky, Saw, Suicide Squad). I only want people who have actually seen these movies, and a rating of 0 signifies that respondent has not seen the movie.
2. For query #2 I am using the list of north east states from lab 1 part 2 to decide if a respondent lives in a north eastern state.
3. I am using the concordance between the movie position in the ratings array and the movie name in my queries.
4. The dataset used is 100 objects. Query #2 returns nothing.

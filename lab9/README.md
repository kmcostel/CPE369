## How to run and compile
* In each directory, there is a "compileAndRun*.sh" script that compiles our code and runs the hadoop job.
  Run the compileAndRun*.sh scripts inside each directory to run each program.

##Notes
* We are only turning in 3 java files working with 2 datasets. It was too difficult to get our code to run on cslvm57 and the MPAC cluser has all nodes as unhealthy as of 3/18 at 10:00 AM
* For Kitchen/ we used 1000.in as input and the output is kitchenUse.output
* For PowerDays/ we used power_sample.txt as input and the output can can be viewed in powerDays.output
* In KitchenUse and PowerDays we have the code doing the NLineInputFormat, but we could not get it to work.
